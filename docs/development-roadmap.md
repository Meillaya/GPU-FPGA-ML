# Development Roadmap

## GPU/FPGA ML Kernel Optimization Project - Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive foundation we've established, here's a strategic roadmap for continuing development of your GPU/FPGA ML kernel optimization project:

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 1-2)

### 1. **Environment Setup and Dependencies**
```bash
# Set up development environment
cd /path/to/GPU-FPGA-ML
python setup_dev.py  # Run the setup script we created
```

**Key tasks:**
- Install CUDA toolkit and verify GPU compatibility
- Set up Triton for GPU kernel development
- Configure profiling tools (nvprof, Nsight Compute)
- Validate PyTorch installation with CUDA support

### 2. **Implement Reference Implementations**
Start with simple, correct implementations before optimizing:

**Priority order:**
1. **Standard Attention** (baseline for FlashAttention)
2. **Basic MoE layer** (single expert, then multi-expert)
3. **Simple kernel fusion examples** (element-wise operations)

### 3. **Create Initial Tests**
```bash
# Run basic functionality tests
python -m pytest tests/test_attention.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_moe.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_fusion.py -v
```

## Short-term Development (Weeks 3-6)

### 4. **FlashAttention Implementation**
**Phase 1:** Basic tiling implementation
- Implement block-wise attention computation
- Add online softmax algorithm
- Verify numerical correctness against reference

**Phase 2:** Optimization
- Tune block sizes for different GPU architectures
- Implement backward pass
- Add causal masking support

### 5. **MoE Routing System**
**Phase 1:** Basic expert selection
- Implement top-k gating
- Create simple expert networks

- Implement MoE routing fusion
- Add automatic fusion detection

---

## Medium-term Goals (Weeks 7-12)

### 7. **Performance Optimization**
```bash
# Run comprehensive benchmarks
python benchmarks/run_all_benchmarks.py
python tools/profile_kernels.py --kernel flashattention
```

**Focus areas:**
- Memory bandwidth optimization
- Occupancy tuning
- Register usage optimization
- Shared memory utilization

### 8. **Integration and Testing**
- Combine all three optimization techniques
- Test on realistic workloads (transformer models)
- Validate end-to-end performance gains
- Add comprehensive error handling

### 9. **FPGA Exploration**
- Research FPGA implementation strategies
- Create initial Verilog/VHDL prototypes
- Benchmark CPU vs GPU vs FPGA trade-offs

## Recommended Development Workflow

### Daily Development Cycle:
```bash
# 1. Write/modify code
# 2. Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# 3. Run benchmarks for modified components
python benchmarks/benchmark_attention.py

# 4. Profile for performance bottlenecks
python tools/profile_memory.py

# 5. Document findings
# Update docs/development-log.md
```

## Notes

This roadmap is designed to be iterative and adaptive. Priorities may shift based on:
- Performance bottlenecks discovered during development
- Hardware constraints or opportunities
- Research insights from the literature
- Practical implementation challenges

Regular weekly reviews should assess progress against milestones and adjust the roadmap as needed. The focus should always be on maintaining code quality, numerical correctness, and measurable performance improvements.

Remember: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - start with correct implementations, then optimize systematically with data-driven decisions.
